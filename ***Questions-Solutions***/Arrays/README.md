While reading the book called "Cracking the Coding Interview", I've been implementing some basic concepts in this book and uploaded them to this repo for my reference.

# Sample Questions
Here are some important question as well as their solutions:

## Arrays:
  Q1. Find the most frequently occurring item in an array.
  
  Q2. Find common elements in two sorted arrays.
